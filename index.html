    <div class = titles> My first steps full time game dev</div>

    <div class = normalText>As an Astra Fellow during the first 7 months of the grant, I’ve been working on several projects and learned diverse skills. This is being an amazing opportunity to focus on learning a lot of different skils outside the game design, to become a more solid contender in the industry. I think taking a look to the initial list of objectives I set myself for this year might be an interesting point of view:
    </div>

    <ul>
        <!-- INNER TAO -->
        <li class = "list">Finishing and releasing "Inner Tao", a sokoban-like that is already in a very advanced state.</li> 
        
            <div class = "container listText">
                <div class = "itemLeft">Inner Tao was released the 12th of April, I spent a month and a half giving final polishing touches and quality of life features (Options Menu, translation to spanish, an ending, a whole revision to the game’s level design, gamepad controls, steam integration…) plus dealing with some basic marketing stuff (press kit, reaching to different media for reviews, handling key giveaways to streamers…) While far from being a commercial success this has been a great experience for future releases. </div>
                <div class = "itemImageInnerTao">
                        <img src="Images/InnerTao2.png" class = "innerTao">
                    </div>
            </div>
        
        <!-- A LOOP IS A LOOP -->
        <li class = "list">Working on a bigger version of "a loop is a loop is", initially this is intended to be a (small) commercial release.</li> 
            <div class = "container listText">
                <div class = "itemRight">
                    After planning some possible new mechanics for A loop is a loop, I started a project from scratch and programmed the base for those mechanics to work. It worked but it wasn't beatiful. I decided to put this on hold until I had more experience with puzzle-platformers, developped my knowledge of Game Maker 2 new coding update, and / or find someone to collaborate with in this project.</div>  
                
                     
            </div>
        
        <!-- 3D and tools-->
        <li class = "list">I have interest in getting to work sometime in the future with 3D, like Unity or Godot. I would also like to learn some basic photoshop or GIMP for improving my art when doing prototypes and marketing. As well as having my own web page, beyond itch, to present myself and my games.</li> 
        
            <div class = "container listText">
                <div class = "itemRight">I haven't yet explored Godot or Unity yet. I focused on the last year Game Maker's 2.3 update, which added a lot of new interesting features as language update (structs, functions...), sequences, animation curves, debugger... 
                    <br>I started my journey with Photopea (a web based photoshop) and web development. This web was made as a personal exam on the skills I learned during the summer. </div>        
            </div>

        <!-- THINKY JAM -->
        <li class = "list">Recently I've been involved with a project called 10mg, which is meant to release groups of 10 games of 10 minutes, from different authors. I started a prototype called "Sunsets" that I would like to finish. </li> 
        
            <div class = "container listText">
                <div class = "itemRight">I almost immediately discarded the idea of finishing "Sunsets", this was a content driven game with very few puzzle interest, and that was started with a prior version of the engine I use, translating into more work. However, I really liked the idea of the collection 10mg, so this summer I got interested in organizing something similar but for Thinky games (a collection of 8-10 new short accessible puzzle games).The project is meant to last for around 5 months, and will start mid september, at the moment I’m still interviewing and trying to find a varied, diverse and auto sufficient team to ensure the project will succeed. </div>
            </div>
        
            <!-- COLLABORATIVE PUZZLESCRIPT -->
        <li class = "list">Participating in the collaborative telephone-puzzlescript games that are now a tradition in Alan Hazelden's discord channel. Probably release a couple tiny puzzlescript games too, since it's a really easy and fast tool for grid based-puzzles. </li> 
        
        <div class = "container listText">
            <div class = "itemImage">
                <img src="Images/PuzzleScriptMontage.png" class = "puzzlescript"></div>
            <div class = "itemRight">So far only one telephone-puzzlescript has been organized (still in development). I also joined “Project 5”, to create a collaborative puzzlescript game with a more common development cycle, where we end up using one of the prototypes I made, however the organization of that project wasn’t solid enough and dissolved after a month. Apart from that, I used puzzlescript for a couple of non-released prototypes. <br>I ended up deciding soon that puzzlescript was not expanding my skillset, that it was a tool I used because of the little time I had past year, so I actively stop working with it for the moment being. </div>
            
        </div>

        <!-- GAME JAMS -->
        <li class = "list">Participate in at least 4 game jams ( 2 Ludum Dare, 1 GMTK Jam and 1 7DRL ) to generate new prototypes.</li> 
        
            <div class = "container listText">
                <div class = "itemRight">So far I already participated in 4 gamejams (1 Ludum Dare, 1 Chain Letter Jam, 1 GMTK and 1 Thinky Puzzle Jam). In these games I allowed me to experiment following some of the design challenges from the next bullet point. </div>
            </div>

         <!-- DESIGN CHALLENGES -->
         <li class = "list">As a design challenge I would love to revisit my "Text less" rule, no text in the game, no exceptions, and write about it in a blog post like last time. Also, I've been interested in trying to avoid sokoban like mechanics since the general audience seem to see this type of games like "all the same", trying to attract more players into the puzzle genre.</li> 
        
         <div class = "containerJam listText">

        <ul>            
            <!-- A LOOP IS A LOOP -->
            <li class = "list">Lab Rat.</li> 
                <div class = "container listText">
                    <div class = "itemRight">
                        I worked full time in Lab Rat during the first month of the grant, this was specifically a puzzle designer task, where I finished the content of the game (the last chapter of 4, plus general polish to the previous sections). During the rest of the year I had to work on this project from time to time with playtesting (which lead me to update or create levels), development followup (I have a weekly call with Gwen to see the progress of the game, and help her in any tasks when needed) and helping managing the audio (I listed the necessary SFX, and give feedback and debating with the audio person, as well as finding royalty free songs)

                    <div class = "itemRight">
                        I worked as a game designer consultant for a math-visualization game project, for 5 weeks part-time. This has been my first freelance job as a prototype developer and has been a very enriching experience.

                        Collaboration with a programmer/artist, where I made a couple of prototypes (in both puzzlescript and Game Maker). This did't work.<br>
                        Recently, I started an ongoing collaboration with a programmer and writer for a puzzle based exploration narrative game (sail the sea guided by the starts and finding new constellations. This is in a very early state and we will be working part time slowly, since we have both other projects going on, but we are excited and have already developed a plan for next month as well as a game design document, made with Notion.

                        During the year, I made some prototypes that I ended up discarding for now because they weren't in line to what I wanted to do next. <br>
